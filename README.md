1 - Create the Database and Tables
Copy the SQL code provided in the sql/db.sql file and paste it into your SQL tool (e.g., phpMyAdmin, MySQL Workbench, or a command-line interface) to create the database and tables.

2 - Configure Database Connection
If the connection doesn't work, check the includes/db.php file. Ensure the following details are correct:
Host: Typically localhost.
Port: Default is 3306, but if you're using a custom port, update it accordingly.
Database Name: The name you provided in the SQL script.
Username and Password: Ensure they match your local MySQL setup.

3 - Start Your Server Environment
Make sure you have XAMPP or WAMP installed.
For XAMPP:
Open the XAMPP Control Panel.
Start the Apache and MySQL services.
For WAMP:
Launch WAMP and ensure the icon in the taskbar turns green, indicating all services are running.

4 - Start the Server
Place the project folder in the htdocs folder (for XAMPP) or the www folder (for WAMP). Open your browser and visit: http://localhost/your-project-folder-name

5 - Simulate a Match
Navigate to the Simulate Match page in the application. Select two teams and click on the "Simulate" button. The result will be saved to the database and displayed on the screen.

Go to the Historique des matches page to view a list of previously played matches.
Visit the Classement page to see team rankings based on their performance.

7 - Customize Your Project
